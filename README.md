Use Python version 3.7 ( Windows 10). There are three Python files with .py extension. Each file can be run independently. File names are given below

1. 2017A3PS1158P-MineSweeper_Game-AI-HillclimbingBasic
2. 2017A3PS1158P-MineSweeper-Game-AI-Simulated_Annealing

Steps to Run Minesweeper each Algorithm file
Run .py file to start the SETUP WIDOW
1. SETUP WINDOW - User input to create Minesweeper Warfield Grid and number of mines.
Input Values 
(a). Enter Height of Grid in the Given Range (1 to 14)
(b). Enter Width of Grid in the Given Range (1 to 14)
(c). Enter Number of Mines Should be less than total size of Warfield
(d) Click Start Button

2. New window (MINESWEEPER) will open based on the data provided in the setup window.
3. Click on the start Button at bottom of the window to RUN the algorithm and wait for results. User don't have to click any button on the Warfield grid. Algorithm will automatically select its next move and it will click the buttons on the Warfield grid.
